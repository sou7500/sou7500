#### This is my Data story

♦ Powered by self-motivation and courage, autodidact, polishing skills and growing with learning.

♦ Overcame fears by practically doing what I learned.

♦ Currently working on portfolio projects, improving portfolio schema on the go, and looking out for opportunities to achieve the dream I had 8 months ago.

### My Approach -  I learned, I attempted, I failed, I researched the cause of failure, I learned again, I attempted again and I succeeded.
