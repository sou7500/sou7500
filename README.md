### Namaste 🙏, I'm Sourabh Kumar - A Data Analyst, Explorer and Poet
#### This is my Data story
![This is my Data story](https://github.com/sou7500/sou7500/blob/main/Data%20Analyst.png)

* Powered by self-motivation and courage, I am on an exploration to Datalantic ocean. My quest is to explore the hidden potential of data.

* Identified risks at an earlier stage and took every step carefully.

* Overcame fears by practically doing what I learned.

* Currently working on portfolio projects, improving portfolio schema on the go, and looking out for opportunities to achieve the dream I had 8 months ago.

### My Approach -  I learned, I attempted, I failed, I researched the cause of failure, I learned again, I attempted again and I succeeded.

### Skills: Tableau, Python, SQL, Excel, Apache Spark
