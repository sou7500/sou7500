## This is my Data story

♦ Learned and applied basics of Excel, SQL & python in graduation.

👨‍💻 Responsibilities forced me to think about my career objectives more precisely and uplift myself.

🧩 When started working as a TRON Associsate at AMAZON, got interacted with data analysis partly, the very first time.

✔ First analyzed data in Excel using pivot table, submit my first report, I found data analysis is something meant for me.

🌐 Researched over google, what it takes to be an Data Analyst, technical skills and interpersonal skills found a match.

🎡 Started polishing my skills using Youtube and Udemy, day by day I became better by learning with peers from all over the world.

🖼 Currently working on portfolio projects, and looking out for opportunities to achieve the dream I had 8 months ago.



# 🙋‍♂️ My Approach -  I learned, I attempted, I failed, I researched the cause of failure, I learned again, I attempted again and I succeeded.
